## üß™ Core Components

### Assessment & Personalization Engine
- Clean, intuitive UI with slider interface for non-intimidating evaluation
- Focus area selection (Emotional Care, Physical Well-Being) enabling user agency
- AI-powered personalization of tasks based on initial assessment, chosen topics, and user inputs

### AI Implementation Details
- **Task Personalization:** AI analyzes user's test responses, chosen topics, and additional input to recommend personalized wellness activities
- **Voice-to-Text Conversion:** Built-in microphone support converts spoken thoughts into text for AI analysis, generating contextually appropriate tasks
- **Content Moderation:** AI system monitors and filters user-to-user notes to maintain a safe, positive environment (blocking content related to alcohol, drugs, inappropriate material, etc.)

### Micro-Intervention System
- Task cards with duration estimates (5-15 minutes) making activities accessible
- Self-reflection prompts, mood tracking, and self-care activities
- Contextual suggestions based on detected emotional states

### Emotional Growth Visualization
- Mind Garden as a visual representation of mental well-being
- Emotion tracking with pattern recognition
- Progress visualization that's engaging without being clinical
